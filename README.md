# Ethereum-Solidity-SmartContracts

## What is ethereum network?
1. Ethereum networks are used to transfer money and store data
2. There are many different Ethereum networks(Test, private, and etc)
3. Networks are formed by one or more nodes
4. Each node is just a machine(Like your laptop) running an ethereum client
5. Anyone with machine can run a node via ethereum client
6. Each node can contain a full copy of the blockcahin(DB of transactions)
7. The blockchain is a db that stores a record of every transaction that's ever taken place

## Address & Keys
1. Account Address is like a user id or email address
2. public and private key combined works like a password
3. keys are used to authorize the sending of funds 
4. keys stored of hexadecimal numbers 
5. An account is used across every ethereum network (Doesn't mean you can't create more of them!)

## Transaction
1. An account is used across all networks, however tokens the account has is unique to the network
2. Transaction is a record that one account attemtpting to send money to another account
3. It is created whenever two accounts exchange money
4. During the demo, transaction object was created and sent to the ethereum network to be processed

### Properties of transaction object
1. nonce : # of times sender has sent a transaction
2. to : Address of receiver
3. value : Amount of ether to be sent
4. startGas/gasLimit : units of gas that this transaction can consume
5. v, r, s : These are generated by senders' private key to be used to generate the senders account address
6. If you have private key you can generate v, r, and s but not the other way around

## Transaction flow of demo
1. Submit form with receiver's address
2. server receives the address and create transaction object using web3 library
3. the server sends transaction object to the Rinkeby test network
4. the server **waits** for transaction to be confirmed 
5. the server sends success message to the client
